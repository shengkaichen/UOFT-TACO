Available data on the sources and pathways of larger floating plastics in freshwater environments is scarce. To bridge this gap, we present a computer vision model prototype to identify trash in primarily natural settings and develop a plan for a future implementation of the model. This would include an additional camera system to identify and collect data on passing trash on the surface of waterways. A system utilizing computer vision technology deployed at multiple sites seeks to inform existing monitoring and removal efforts while providing valuable open-access environmental data for the broader scientific community.
